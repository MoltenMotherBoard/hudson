## Scripts for the personal MoltenMotherBoard Jenkins
As we're actually capable to run a Jenkins instance on a private (for home purpose) server, we're using these scripts in order to just invoke the build.

The server, when is up, is reachable at:
http://moltenmotherboard.noip.me
You won't be able to download anything from this server, as it uses a home network (that can not handle a normal server daily traffic); for this same reason (being a server for home purpose) you will be able to just see builds status and finished builds checksum.


As of April 2015, the server is not routed properly because of ISP. (*doh*)

As of April 19th, 2015, the server can be reached at http://moltenmotherboard.noip.me:4321/jenkins
