## Scripts for the personal MoltenMotherBoard Jenkins
As we're actually capable to run a Jenkins instance on a private (for home purpose) server, we're using these scripts in order to just invoke the build.

The server, when is up, is reachable at:
http://moltenmotherboard.noip.me

As of April 2015, the server is not routed properly because of ISP. (*doh*)
